We have developed an exam consisting of five tasks for our astronauts and we need to convert their raw score into a percentage that we can later use to rank astronauts.

The conversion should work as follows:
- If an astronaut completes 0 tasks, he or she earns 0 percent.
- If an astronaut completes 1 task, he or she earns 10 percent.
- If an astronaut completes 2 tasks, he or she earns 25 percent.
- If an astronaut completes 3 tasks, he or she earns 45 percent.
- If an astronaut completes 4 tasks, he or she earns 70 percent.
- If an astronaut completes 5 tasks, he or she earns 100 percent.

Please write us a program that asks the user to enter the number of tasks that a given astronaut has completed and then displays the percentage scored.

Things you need to pass the tests:
- Input 1: "How many tasks did the astronaut complete?"
- Output 1: "The astronaut's score is `[percentage]` percent."
